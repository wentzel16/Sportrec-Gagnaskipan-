# Registration system for sports club
# The assignment is to program a system for registering data about sports, groups and members
# in a sports club. There is no particular API or class description to fill in and no part of the tests
# will be automated. The assignments will be evaluated based on functionality that works through
# the user interface. Code will be evaluated based on organization of classes and operations and
# what data structures are used. Operations that do not work in the user interface will not be
# evaluated for partial points based on code. User interfaces are evaluated based on efficiency
# and clarity of information, not on beauty. Text-based UI is sufficient.
# Base functionality - 50%

# ● User shall be able to remove a member from the system
# ● User shall be able to remove a sport from the system
# ● User shall be able to see a list of all members and order it on different data
# ○ Ordered by name
# ○ Ordered by age
# ○ Ordered by sport
# ● User shall be able to retrieve members by different data
# ○ Get by name
# ○ Get by phone
# ○ Get by email
# ○ Get by age or year of birth
# ● User shall be able to select a member and see detailed information about them

# ○ All sports this user is registered in
# ● User shall be able to see a list of sports
# ● User shall be able to select a sport and see detailed information
# ○ List of users in the sport
# Operation memory and undo - 10%
# ● The system shall keep track of every operation done in the system
# ○ At least operations that change data
# ● The user shall be able to undo the last operation
# ○ Then the next-to-last, etc… like undo usually works
# Groups in sports - 10%

# ○ Possible to sign into more than one group, if age allows
# ● When viewing details for a sport the user should see a list of groups
# ● User should be able to select a group and see details
# ○ List of users in a group
# ● When viewing details on a user the sport and group should be displayed in list
# Waiting lists - 10%
# ● The user shall be able to register a maximum number of members in a group
# ● If a group is full a member is added to waiting list instead
# ● If member is removed from a full group a member from the waiting list is added instead
# ○ Notify the user when this happens
# Persistent data - 10%
# ● The system shall store all data in files
# ○ Store when system is closed
# ■ prompt?
# ○ Store when user chooses to save
# ● The system shall read everything from the files when the system starts
# ○ Read data into more efficient data structures in memory
# Efficient data structures - 10%
# ● Efficient data structures should be used for each function of the system
# ○ Not everything in lists that are then sorted over and over
# ■ Use sorted structures when needed
# ■ Use multi-key structures where applicable
# ● But not when not needed
# ○ Use simple structures like stack and queue when sufficient
# Efficient flow of operations - 10%
# ● Make your system pleasant to use :)
# ○ Quick selections
# ■ Have numbered lines rather than having to enter full strings
# ○ Clear user interface
# ■ Windowed UI not required
# ● Operation can still be made clear and obvious
